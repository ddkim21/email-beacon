NOTABLE FILES    
server.js:
  - Contains routes that make up the core functionality of the app.
    - '/geturl/:email' will post an email object (stored as string) into the redis database with a unique key.
      - returns a URL for an image request that corresponds to the unique key used to store the email object.
      - returns an error if the input string is not a valid email.
    - '/image/:uuid' will query the redis database for the email object with the unique key. 
      - If an email object with the unique key is found, server.js will:
        - Update the email object (with the relevant IP address of access, time opened, etc.) and post it to redis.
        - console.log details on the email access, such as recipient email, ip address, and on reopen, whether it was opened on the same device as the first email.
      - If an email object with the unique key is not found, server.js will return an error.
  
redis-helpers.js
  - Contains helper functions that return function promises containing redis requests for a given redis server. 
    - storeObjectThunk returns a function that returns a promise to store an email object to redis.
    - getObjectThunk returns a function that returns a promise to get an email object from redis.
  
constants.js
  - Stores error messages used across the app for various error cases (including error cases not covered in my description of server.js above, such as redis client failure)
  - Stores appended email accessor for email object UUIDs. 
  
helpers.js
  - Helpers involving error handling and console.logging the details of the email access.
